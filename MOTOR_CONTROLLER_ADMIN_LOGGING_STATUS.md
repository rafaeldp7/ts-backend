## ‚ùå **Functions WITHOUT Admin Logging**

### **READ Operations (No Logging Needed)**
These are read-only operations and typically don't require logging:

1. ‚úÖ **getMotors** - List all motorcycles (read-only)
2. ‚úÖ **getMotor** - Get single motorcycle (read-only)
3. ‚úÖ **getMotorStats** - Get statistics (read-only)
4. ‚úÖ **getMotorsByBrand** - Search by model (read-only)
5. ‚úÖ **getUserMotors** - Get user motorcycles (read-only)

**Why No Logging?**
- These are GET requests (read operations)
- No data modification occurs
- Standard practice: only log data-changing operations
- Reduces unnecessary log entries
