# Motor Controller Update Summary

## üéØ **Changes Made**

### **Reason for Update**
The motor controller has been updated to use the `Motorcycle` model (motorcycle catalog) instead of the `Motor` model (user motorcycles), because **your data already exists in the Motorcycle database**.

---

## üìã **Summary of Changes**

### **1. Updated Imports** ‚úÖ
```javascript
// Before
const Motor = require('../../../models/Motor');

// After
const Motorcycle = require('../../../models/motorcycleModel');
const Motor = require('../../../models/Motor'); // Keep for reference
```

### **2. Updated Functions** ‚úÖ

#### **getMotors**
- Now queries `Motorcycle` model (catalog)
- Returns motorcycle specifications (model, engineDisplacement, power, torque, fuelTank, fuelConsumption)
- Simplified data structure (no user data)

#### **getMotor**
- Now queries `Motorcycle` model
- Returns single motorcycle specification

#### **updateMotor**
- Now updates `Motorcycle` model
- Accepts: model, engineDisplacement, power, torque, fuelTank, fuelConsumption
- Logs as `MOTORCYCLE` resource

#### **deleteMotor**
- Now deletes from `Motorcycle` model
- Soft delete (sets isDeleted = true)
- Logs as `MOTORCYCLE` resource

#### **createMotor**
- Now creates `Motorcycle` records
- Accepts: model, engineDisplacement, power, torque, fuelTank, fuelConsumption
- Checks for duplicate models
- Logs as `MOTORCYCLE` resource

#### **restoreMotor**
- Now restores `Motorcycle` records
- Soft delete restoration (sets isDeleted = false)
- Logs as `MOTORCYCLE` resource

#### **getMotorStats**
- Now queries `Motorcycle` model
- Returns: totalMotors, deletedMotors, newMotorsThisMonth
- Simplified statistics (no brand/year/fuelType aggregation)

#### **getMotorsByBrand**
- Now searches by `model` instead of `brand`
- Returns motorcycles matching model name pattern
- Logs as `MOTORCYCLE` resource

## üîÑ **Data Models**

### **Motorcycle Model (Now Being Used)**
```javascript
{
  model: String,              // e.g., "Honda CBR 600RR"
  engineDisplacement: Number, // e.g., 600
  power: String,             // e.g., "80 HP"
  torque: String,            // e.g., "60 Nm"
  fuelTank: Number,          // 15 L
  fuelConsumption: Number,    // km/L (required)
  isDeleted: Boolean
}
```

### **Motor Model (Previous User Motorcycles)**
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,          // User who owns the motorcycle
  nickname: String,
  brand: String,
  model: String,
  year: Number,
  color: String,
  licensePlate: String,
  fuelTank: Number,
  fuelConsumption: Number,
  currentFuelLevel: Number,
  odometer: Number,
  analytics: Object,
  isDeleted: Boolean,
  deletedAt: Date,
  deletedBy: ObjectId
}
```

## ‚úÖ **What This Fixes**

1. **Uses existing motorcycle data** - Your Motorcycle collection data is now accessible
2. **Proper schema alignment** - Controller matches Motorcycle schema fields
3. **Correct logging** - All actions log as `MOTORCYCLE` resource
4. **Simplified data** - Catalog data (no user relationships needed)
5. **Frontend compatibility** - Response format matches motorcycle catalog structure

## üöÄ **Benefits**

‚úÖ **Uses your existing data** - Works with motorcycle catalog data you already have  
‚úÖ **Simpler data model** - No user relationships needed  
‚úÖ **Proper logging** - All actions logged as MOTORCYCLE  
‚úÖ **Catalog management** - Perfect for managing motorcycle specifications  
‚úÖ **No data migration needed** - Uses existing Motorcycle collection

## üìù **Important Notes**

1. **This is for the motorcycle CATALOG**, not user motorcycles
2. **Motor model still exists** - Can be used later for user motorcycle tracking
3. **Data structure** - Simplified (no userId, analytics, etc.)
4. **Admin management** - Perfect for managing motorcycle specifications
5. **Frontend** - Must send model, engineDisplacement, power, torque, fuelTank, fuelConsumption
